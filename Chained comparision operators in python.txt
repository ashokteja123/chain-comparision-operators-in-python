       *Chained Comparison Operators*

Instesd of comparing multiple condition ,we can combine in one like we write in mathematics i.e 18<=age<59.this is known as chaining comparision operators.

Let's look at a few examples of using chains:

1 < 2 < 3
True

The above statement checks if 1 was less than 2 and if 2 was less than 3. We could have written this using an 'and' statement in Python:

1<2 and 2<3
True

The and is used to make sure two checks have to be true in order for the total check to be true. Let's see another example:

1 < 3 > 2
True

The above checks if 3 is larger than both of the other numbers, so you could use and to rewrite it as:

1<3 and 3>2
True

It's important to note that Python is checking both instances of the comparisons. We can also use or to write comparisons in Python. For example:

1==2 or 2<3
True

Note how it was true; this is because with the or operator, we only need one or the other to be true. Let's see one more example .

1==1 or 100==1
True
